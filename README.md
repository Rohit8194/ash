# ash
Used for ASH on muffle furnence method
/* 
c_work_ash_calculation This code is written in c language and used to check and manipulate (in case) calculation of sulphated ash / ash of organic material
This code will give you the value of weight after ignition and total weight of material and that pod which is used if you use muffle furnance method to
determination of ash, 
for example
the weight of pot you use is ..... (Pot is a boul, made of marble having very high melting point)
And the sample weightof material is ..... (Sample could be of any organic or inorganic material and is taken by weight)
And, you want ash% to be ..... ( when You know aproximate value (in %age) of ash of a perticular material) 
You will calculate what should be the weight of pod+sample after ignition And the weight of ash after ignition
